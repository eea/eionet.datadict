<h2>Suggested values edit page</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the suggested values for this element and provides features to edit them.
    <br/>
    <br/> An element's suggested values are a set of values that the Data Dictionary suggests to use if the data provider
    is not sure about which value to provide. These values are by no means mandatory to use. You serve a helping function
    only. Note that suggested values can only be specified for data elements with quantitative values, i.e. not elements
    with fixed values.
    <br/>
    <br/> Every suggested value here in this list is represented by the value itself and the value's definition which helps
    to understand the value's meaning. Values are clickable and they lead to the value's detailed page.
    <br/>
    <br/> To <b>add new values</b>, use the new value's input box and Add button. For <b>deletion</b>, use checkboxes to
    select the desired values and press Delete. The Remove all button speaks for itself.
