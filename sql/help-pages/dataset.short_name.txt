<h2>Short name</h2>
<p>
    A short name is a character string used to operationally identify content components within the Data Dictionary. ie how users
    and data definers commonly refer to a table or an element or a dataset. A short name is not used as a unique identifier
    in Data Dictionary. For example, several tables in a dataset can have the same short name. A short name can contain any
    characters, including white space.
