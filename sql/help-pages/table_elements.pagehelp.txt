<h2>Table elements</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the elements in the given table.
</p>
<p>
    If you have authenticated yourself and this table belongs to your dataset working copy then on top of the page you will see
    inputs and buttons enabling you to add new elements to this table or remove existing ones.
    <ul>
        <li>
            To <strong>add a new non-common element</strong> enter the new element's alphanumeric identifier into the <em>Identifier</em> box, select the element's Type and click Add or Copy. The element's type can be either either <strong>Quantitative</strong> or <strong>Fixed values</strong>. The first one means elements that can have any value within their data type.
            The second one means elements whose value-set is pre-determined.
            <br/>
            <strong>Add</strong> creates a new element with the Identifier and Type you selected and it will lead you to
            the element's edit page where you can enter the rest of the element's attributes.
            <br/>
            <strong>Copy</strong> too creates a new element with the Identifier and Type you selected, but it will prompt
            you to select another element from which to copy the rest of the new element's attributes. The prompt will open
            a view where you can search for the element whose attributes you want to copy. Once you've clicked the desired
            element in the search results, DD will create a new non-common element where the attributes have been taken from
            the element you selected to copy, but the Identifier and Type are the ones you entered above. It will then lead
            you to the edit page of that newly created element where you can edit the rest of the element's definition.
        </li>
        <li>
            To <strong>add an existing common element</strong> click the <strong>Link</strong> button. It will open a search
            page where you can search for the common element you want to add to this table. In the search results, click
            the desired element and you will be led back to this view where you will see the selected common element among
            the table's elements.
        </li>
        <li>
            To <strong>remove existing elements</strong> from this table, select the elements with the help of checkboxes
            in the left-most column and click <strong>Remove selected</strong>. As a result, the page is refreshed and the
            selected elements should be gone.
            <nr/>
            <strong>Note that removing a common element does not delete it from the DD. It will simply be removed
from this table, but it remains in DD to be used by other tables and datasets.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Save order</strong> button saves the order of the elements. You can change the order by clicking
            on the row of the element you want to move up or down. This will paint the row to blue. Once this is done, use
            the moving buttons on the table's right. One arrow will move by one position, two arrows will move the selected
            row to the beginning or the end. Just like CD player. Click Save order to save the changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br/>

<p>
    The list of elements is given by 4 columns:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Short name</strong> is the element's short name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>GIS</strong> indicates the element's GIS type. If the element is not a GIS element, the value says 'no
            GIS'. If it's a GIS element, but the GIS type is unknown, the value is simply empty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Datatype</strong> indicates the element's data type.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Element type</strong> indicates the element's data type. It is either <strong>Quantitative</strong> or
            <strong>Fixed values</strong>. See above for what those types mean.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Common elements are <strong>marked by <span class="commonelm"><sup>C</sup></strong></span>.<br/> If a non-common
    element has foreign key relations to elements in other tables in this dataset, it is
    <strong>marked by <span class="barfont"><em>(FK)</em></span></strong>.
