<h2>Data element search page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to search for common or non-common elements.
</p>
<p>
    More about <strong>search criteria</strong> is available by clicking the information icons in their titles.<br/> You
    can add more search criteria by using the blue '+' sign at the bottom part of the page. You can remove added criteria
    by clicking the blue '-' sign that will appear next to them.
</p>
<p>
    The radio buttons below the criteria enable to set the <strong>search type</strong>. Possible options are:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Substring search.</strong> This will interpret your inputs as substrings of what you're searching for.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exact search.</strong> This will interpret your inputs as the exact phrase you're looking for.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Free text search.</strong> This will interpret your inputs as free text.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are also radio buttons for specifying if you want to search only for <strong>common elements</strong> or only for
    <strong>non-common elements</strong>. The latter is the default.
    <br/>
    <strong>If you check 'common elements', the dataset select box becomes disabled</strong>, because common elements are
    not strictly related to one single dataset. <strong>If you check 'non-common' elements, the dataset select box
is enabled, but the 'Working copies only' checkbox becomes disabled</strong>, because there can be no working copies of non-common
    elements.
</p>
<p>
    If you have authenticated yourself then you will see the <strong>Working copies only</strong> checkbox. If this is checked,
    only working copies are searched for.
</p>
<p>
    Both authenticated and un-authenticated users should see the <strong>Include historic versions</strong> checkbox. If
    this is checked, DD returns also all the historic element versions matching your search criteria.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Search</strong> button speaks for itself. <strong>Reset</strong> clears your search criteria.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NB!</strong> If all the criteria are blank, DD resturns all the latest common element versions or non-common
    elements from all the latest dataset versions, depending on which radio button you checked.
</p>
<p>
    If you have authenticated yourself and you have the required permissions, you will see the
    <strong>New common element</strong> action link in the upper right corner of the page. This will lead you the page where
    you can start creating a new common element.
