<h2>Common element view page</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Common elements</strong> do not belong into a certain single table. They can be used in many tables. A perfect
    example of a common element is for example CountryCode. It is obvious that CountryCode is probably needed in many datasets.
    <br/>
    <strong>Non-common elements</strong> belong into a certain single table and they cannot be used in any other tables.
    They are defined within that certain table and they do not have a life outside of that table.
</p>
<p>
    The view page of common elements is slightly different from the view page of non-common ones.
</p>
<p>
    If you have authenticated yourself and you have the required permissions, the upper right corner of the page may contain
    the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>New version</strong> will create a new version of this element. You will be instantly led to the view
            page of that new version where you can start editing it. It will be a working copy until you check it in.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Check out</strong> will do the same as New version, the only difference is that the working copy will not
            become a new version when checked in. Instead, it will simply overwrite the current element copy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Delete</strong> deletes this element copy. This does not mean that if you are viewing a CountryCode common
            element and you press Delete, then all versions of CountryCode commone element will be deleted. Only the version
            you are viewing will be deleted!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Also in the upper right corner you may find these action links:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Go to newest</strong> leads you the view page of the newest version of this element. Seeing this action
            link indicates that you are viewing an historic version of this element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscribe</strong> will subscribe you to any changes made to any version of this element. EIONET's Unified
            Notification System (UNS) will send you notifications about those changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        This page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at the top
        of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below the quicklinks is a section with links to <strong>XML schema</strong> and possibly other formats of this element
        definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next is a section that states the element's type. It can be one of two:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted
                values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type.
                DD enables to define suggested values for these elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the element's type is a section that lists the element's <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is
        a name/value pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. Help on every attribute is available
        by the help icons in their titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the attributes is a section that lists one of two:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Allowable values</strong> are a synonym of fixed values and they are listed if the element's type
                is fixed values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Suggested values</strong> are listed if the element's type is quantitative values. They are values
                suggested to the data supplier if he does not know or is not sure what to enter. The data supplier is not
                obliged to use them.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If this common element is used in any tables, then the next section lists <strong>tables using this element</strong>.
        Every table is given with its name (clickable and the click leads to its vew page), dataset name (also clickable
        and leads to the dataset's view page) and the table's owner given by user name.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the very bottom of the page is the list of <strong>other versions</strong> of this common element. Every version
        is uniquely identified by the element number in the left-most column. The list also indicates the version's Registration
        status and the date it was released (relevant only when the Registration status is <em>Released</em>). The right-most
        column of this list provides the link to the view page of that version.
