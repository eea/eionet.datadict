<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>
    This page lists <strong>tables from latest versions of datasets in any status</strong> or
    <strong>tables matching your search criteria</strong> if you reached this page by submitting the table. The latter is
    accessible by clicking the <strong>Search</strong> link in the upper right corner.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tables from datasets NOT in Recorded or Released status are inaccessible
for un-authenticated users!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All users can see 4 columns here:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Full name</strong> indicates the table's full name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Short name</strong> indicates the table's short name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dataset</strong> indicates the dataset where the table belongs to. Note that if a dataset name is marked
            by a red asterisk (<span style="color:red">*</span>), it means the dataset has been checked out by somebody
            and the EIONET user name of that somebody is displayed if you point the mouse over the asterisk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dataset status</strong> indicates the Registration status of the dataset where the table belongs to.
            The different statuses are marked by certain icons. The status names are dispalyed when placing the mouse over
            those icons.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If you place the mouse over column header and the latter activates, it means the list is <strong>sortable</strong> by
    that column. Click the column header to perform the sorting.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned above, dataset statuses are marked by certain icons and you can see the status name by placing the mouse over
    the icon. Here's what different status names mean:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Released</strong> (5 ticks) means the definition is accepted by ETCs and EEA and is released for countries
            to use for download of technical guidelines and templates. Definitions in this status can be accessed by countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Qualified</strong> (4 ticks) level is for closing discussions between ETCs and EEA. Definitions in this
            status <em>cannot be accessed by countries.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recorded</strong> (3 ticks) level is for discussions between ETCs and countries if applicable. Otherwise
            the definition will skip this status and move directly to the Qualified status. Definitions in Recorded status
            can be accessed by countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Candidate</strong> (2 ticks) means definitions that are included in the Data Dictionary by the EEA or
            ETC data managers. This level is for opening discussions between ETCs and EEA. Definitions in this status
            <em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Incomplete</strong> (1 tick) means either existing definitions under consideration to include them into
            Data Dictionary or new definitions under development where the Data Dictionary is used as a structuring tool
            or to test dataflows. Definitions in this status
            <em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
