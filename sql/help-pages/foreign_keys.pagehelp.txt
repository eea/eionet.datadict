<h2>Foreign key relations</h2>
<p>
    Datsets consist of tables and it is only natural that tables can be in foreign key relations with each other. In Data Dictionary
    foreign key relations are represented by defining a foreign key relation between an elements in one table and an element
    in another table. The tables have to reside in one and the same dataset.
    <br/>
    <br/> This page is a list of elements which the selected element is in foreign key relations with. The list is given
    by 3 columns:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Element</b>: the element's short name.<br/> It is clickable. The click opens the foreign key element's view
            page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Table</b>: the element's table's short name
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cardinality</b>: the type of relationship.<br/> This can be 0-to-1, 0-to-one-or-more, 1-to-1, etc. Just like
            in terms of relational databases. See more in the help of the relation's detailed view.
        </li>
    </ul>
    If the elemenet whose foreign keys you are looking at is in edit mode, then you should also see the buttons for adding new
    relations and deleting existing ones.<br/> To <b>add</b> new relations, click the 'Add' button and this will open
    a window where you can search for elements in this dataset. When you get the search result list, click the desired element
    and it will copied to the list of foreign key relations.<br/> To <b>delete</b> existing relations, use the checkboxes
    in front of rows and the 'Remove' button on top of the table.
