<h2>Generating MS Excel templates for tables</h2>
<p>
    MS Excel is one of the most popular formats of data reporting in Reportnet.
    To help to ease the task of producing them, Data Dictionary enables to
    generate templates for the MS Excel files to be reported.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An MS Excel template for a given table is a workbook, where there's only
    one sheet and <b>it is the sheet representing the table</b>. It has titled columns
    where <b>every such column and title represents a data element in this table</b>.
    The titles are the short names of data elements. For further information about the
    elements you have to look at the definitions in DD or the PDF you might have generated.

    <br/>
    <b>NB!</b> Please note that for GIS tables the one sheet is split into two! One for GIS
    elements, titled <i>tablename</i> and one for non-GIS elements, titled <i>tablename-meta</i>.
