<h2>Allowable values</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the allowable values (aka fixed values) for this element.
    <br/>
    <br/> An element's allowable values are a set of pre-fixed values which the element can have. It cannot have any other
    values once these are specified. And they can be specified only if the element is set to be of fixed values type.
    <br/>
    <br/> Every allowable value here in this list is represented first by the value itself and then the value's definition
    and the value's short description. The latter two help to understand the meaning of the value. Values are clickable and
    they lead to the value's detailed page.
    <br/>
    <br/> If the element whose values you are looking at is in edit mode, then you can also see here in this page the 'Edit'
    button. Use this button to go into mode where you can add/remove new/existing values.
