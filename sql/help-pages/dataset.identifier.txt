<h2>Identifier</h2>
<p>
    Identifier is a unique identifier that is mainly used for internal purposes in the Data Dictionary. It is a character string
    used to distinguish different elements, tables and datasets within the same context. It's maximum length is 50 characters
    and it must have no blank spaces. Identifiers are also used as tag names to distinguish elements in XML-formatted data,
    so their syntax must apply to the same rules as those of XML tags.

    <b>NB!</b> A table identifier must be unique within its parent dataset. A data element identifier must be unique within
    its parent table.
