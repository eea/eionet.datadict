<h2>Generating MS Excel templates for datasets</h2>
<p>
    MS Excel is one of the most popular formats of data reporting in Reportnet. To help to ease the task of producing them, Data
    Dictionary enables to generate templates for the MS Excel files to be reported.
    <br/>
    <br/> In MS Excel format every DD dataset is represented by a workbook, where
    <b>every sheet represents a dataset table by having the table's short name!</b> Sheets have titled columns where <b>every such column and title represents
    a data element</b>. The titles are the short names of data elements. For further information about the elements you have
    to look at the definitions in DD or the PDF you might have generated.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>NB!</b> Please note that GIS tables are represented by two separate sheets.<br/> The one for GIS elements is titled
    <i>tablename</i> and the one for non-GIS elements<br/> is titled <i>tablename-meta</i>.
