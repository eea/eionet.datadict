<h2>Common element working copy view page</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Non-common elements</strong> belong into a certain single table and they cannot be used in any other tables.
    They are defined within that certain table and they do not have a life outside of that table.
    <br/>
    <strong>Common elements</strong> do not belong into a certain single table. They can be used in many tables. A perfect
    example of a common element is for example CountryCode. It is obvious that CountryCode is probably needed in many datasets.
</p>
<p>
    When you check out a common element or create new version of it, DD creates a new copy of that element and that will be your
    <strong>working copy</strong>. This is the copy where you do your changes and once you're done, you check it in. The check-in makes your
    changes visible to others. If you checked in with the Registration status of <em>Released</em> or
    <em>Recorded</em>, your changes will become visible to everybody, including un-authenticated users. If the Registration
    status was anything else, your changes will be visible to authenticated users only.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right corner of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Edit</strong> will open the element's edit form.</li>
        <li><strong>Check in</strong> will check in all edits that you did.</li>
        <li><strong>Undo checkout</strong> cancels the checkout and deletes the working copy.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/> The <strong>Subscribe</strong> action also available in the upper right corner will subscribe you to any changes
    made to any version of this element. EIONET's Unified Notification System (UNS) will send you notifications about those
    changes.

    This view page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at the
    top of the page.

    This page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at the top of
    the page.
</p>
<p>
    Below the quicklinks is a section with links to <strong>XML schema</strong> and possibly other formats of this element
    definition.
</p>
<p>
    Next is a section that states the element's type. It can be one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type. DD
            enables to define suggested values for these elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Following the element's type is a section that lists the element's <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is a
    name/value pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. Help on every attribute is available by the
    help icons in their titles.
</p>
<p>
    Following the attributes is a section that lists one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Allowable values</strong> are a synonym of fixed values and they are listed if the element's type is
            fixed values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suggested values</strong> are listed if the element's type is quantitative values. They are values suggested
            to the data supplier if he does not know or is not sure what to enter. The data supplier is not obliged to use
            them.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If this common element is used in any tables, then the next section lists <strong>tables using this element</strong>.
    Every table is given with its name (clickable and the click leads to its vew page), dataset name (also clickable and
    leads to the dataset's view page) and the table's owner given by user name.
</p>
<p>
    At the very bottom of the page is the list of <strong>other versions</strong> of this common element. Every version is
    uniquely identified by the element number in the left-most column. The list also indicates the version's Registration
    status and the date it was released (relevant only when the Registration status is <em>Released</em>). The right-most
    column of this list provides the link to the view page of that version.
