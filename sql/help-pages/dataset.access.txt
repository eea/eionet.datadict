<h2>Generating MS Access templates for datasets</h2>
<p>
    MS Access is among the most popular formats of reporting data in Reportnet. To help to ease the task of producing this format,
    Data Dictionary enables to generate templates for the MS Access files to be reported.
</p>
<p>
    The relation between the generated MS Access templates and datasets in DD is quite straight-forward and logical.
</p>
<p>
    Every generated MS Access template corresponds to a concrete dataset definition in DD. Tables in that template represent
    the tables in DD. And columns in those MS Access tables represent the data elements in DD.
</p>
<p>
    Tables and columns in generated MS Access files are titled by the identifiers of their counterparts in DD.
</p>
<p>
    The columns in generated MS Access have their data types set according to the data types of their counterparts. Here's the
    mapping between DD data types and data types in generated MS Access files:
</p>
<table>

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>DD data type</th>
            <th>MS Access data type</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>boolean</td>
            <td>boolean</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>integer</td>
            <td>int</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>date</td>
            <td>text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>float</td>
            <td>float</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tr>
</table>
<p>
    <b>
At the moment the utility DD is using to generate its MS Access outputs
does not unfortunately enable to set fixed values for the generated columns!
</b>
</p>
<p>
    About each and every column you can find out more specifications by looking at the corresponding data element in DD or its
    description in generated PDF output.
</p>
<p>
    <b>NB!</b> Please note that GIS tables in DD are represented in MS Access as two separate tables. The one for GIS elements
    is titled <i>tablename</i> and the one for non-GIS elements is titled <i>tablename_meta</i>.
