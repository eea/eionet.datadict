<h2>Dataset view page</h2>
<p>
    This page provides a view to a dataset definition.
    <p>
        If you have authenticated yourself and you have the required permissions, the upper right corner of the page may contain
        the following buttons:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>New version</strong> will create a new version of this dataset. You will be instantly led to the
                view page of that new version where you can start editing it. It will be a working copy until you check it
                in.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Check out</strong> will do the same as New version, the only difference is that the working copy will
                not become a new version when checked in. Instead, it will simply overwrite the current dataset copy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Delete</strong> deletes this dataset copy. This does not mean that if you are viewing a Lakes dataset
                and you press Delete, then all versions of Lakes dataset will be deleted. Only the version you are viewing
                will be deleted!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br/> Also in the upper right corner you may find these action links:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Go to newest</strong> leads you the view page of the newest version of this dataset. Seeing this
                action link indicates that you are viewing an historic version of this dataset.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Subscribe</strong> will subscribe you to any changes made to any version of this dataset. EIONET's
                Unified Notification System (UNS) will send you notifications about those changes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This view page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at
        the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below the quicklinks is a section with links to <strong>documents & templates</strong> available for this dataset.
        If you have the right to modify this dataset definition then you can also see the links for uploading new documents
        and managing the documents' cache. You can find more help when you get there.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next section lists all the <strong>attributes</strong> of this definition. Every attribute is a name/value pair.
        Some attributes can have several values at the same time. Help on every attribute is available by the help icons
        in their titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the dataset has a <strong>data model</strong> specified, the attributes are followed by a section that displayes
        the thumbnail of the data model image.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the data model is the section that lists the <strong>tables</strong> in this dataset. Each table is given
        by its full name and short name, is clickable and the click leads to the table's definition view page.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the very bottom of the page is the list of <strong>other versions</strong> of this dataset definition. Every version
        is uniquely identified by the dataset number in the left-most column. The list also has indicating the version's
        Registration status and the date is was released (relevant only when the Registration status is <em>Released</em>).
