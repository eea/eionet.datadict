<h2>Allowable values edit page</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the allowable values (aka fixed values) for this element and provides features to edit them.
    <br/>
    <br/> An element's allowable values are a set of pre-fixed values which the element can have. It cannot have any other
    values once these are specified. And they can be specified only if the element is set to be of fixed values type.
    <br/>
    <br/> Every allowable value here in this list is represented by the value itself and the value's definition which helps
    to understand the value's meaning. Values are clickable and they lead to the value's detailed page.
    <br/>
    <br/> To <b>add new values</b>, use the new value's input box and Add button. For <b>deletion</b>, use checkboxes to
    select the desired values and press Delete. The Remove all button speaks for itself.
    <br/>
    <br/> It is also possible to <b>import</b> new values from an XML-formatted file extracted from Data Dictionary's Import
    tool. More help will be availabale if you click the Import... button.
