<h2>Registration status</h2>
<p>
    Each dataset and common element definition in Data Dictionary goes through a life-cycle. Its phases are marked by Registration
    status (aka simply status). The Registration status of a dataset or common element definition is specified by the data
    definers and can be any one of the following:
</p>

<h3>Released (5 ticks)</h3>
<p>
    The definition is accepted by ETCs and EEA and is released for countries to use for download of technical guidelines and
    templates.<br/> Definitions in this status can be accessed by countries.
</p>
<h3>Qualified (4 ticks)</h3>
<p>
    This level is for closing discussions between ETCs and EEA.<br/> Definitions in this status <b>cannot be accessed by countries.</b>
</p>
<h3>Recorded (3 ticks)</h3>
<p>
    This level is for discussions between ETCs and countries if applicable. Otherwise the definition will skip this status and
    move directly to the Qualified status.<br/> Definitions in Recorded status can be accessed by countries.</p>
<h3>Candidate (2 ticks)</h3>
<p>
    Definitions that are included in the Data Dictionary by the EEA or ETC data managers. This level is for opening discussions
    between ETCs and EEA.<br/> Definitions in this status <b>cannot be accessed by countries.</b>
</p>
