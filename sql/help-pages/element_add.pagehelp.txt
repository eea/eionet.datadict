<h2>Non-common element add page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to create a new non-common element in the given table in the given dataset.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right section of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> creates the new element with the values you entered into the form below. It will lead you
            to the edit page of that new element where you can edit the rest of the element's definition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Copy</strong> enables you to create a new non-common element by copying the basic attributes from another,
            already existing non-common element. It will open a view where you can search for the element you want to copy.
            Once you've clicked the desired element in the search results, DD will create a new non-common element where
            the basic attributes have been taken from the element you selected to copy. It will lead you to the edit page
            of that newly created element where you can edit the rest of the element's definition.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Please note that both Add and Copy buttons require you to
    <strong>specify the mandatory attributes</strong> marked with M.
    </ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Having reached this page, you must have already specified the element's Type which is one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type. DD
            enables to define suggested values for these elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <strong>
If this element's type is QUANTITATIVE VALUES then the first thing you must do on this page
is to select the new element's Datatype. </strong> This is emphasized because that selection reloads the page with empty
    inputs, so you will lose anything you entered prior to performing that selection.
</p>
<p>
    Inputs on this page represent the element's <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is a name/value pair. Some attributes
    can have several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the +/- icons next to the inputs.
    '+' adds a new value, '-' removes selected values.<br/>Help on every attribute is available by clicking their help icons.<br/> 
    The <strong>Table</strong> and <strong>Dataset</strong> attributes indicate the table and dataset the element belongs
    to. Both are clickable and the click leads to their view pages.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've entered the data, you are ready to press either Add or Copy.
