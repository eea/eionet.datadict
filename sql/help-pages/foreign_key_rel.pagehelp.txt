    This page lists and enabls to edit the <b>details of a foreign key relation</b>.
    <br/>
    <br/> A foreign key relation in DD's terms is the same as it is in terms of relational databases, because in principal
    a DD dataset is a database. A foreign key relation exists between two columns of separate tables in the same database.
    So in DD a foreign key relation exists between two elements of separate tables in the same dataset.
    <br/> The relation is described by its <b>Description<b> and its <b>Cardinality</b>. The latter indicates if the relation
    is 0-to-1, 0-to-one-or-more, 1-to-1, etc. Please keep in mind that in Data Dictionary a foreign key relation is <b>direction-less</b>.
    Nevertheless, the sides of the relation are marked by <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, just to notify that we're tlaking about
    sides.
