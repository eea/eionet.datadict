<h2>Dataset number</h2>
<p>
    Data Dictionary enables to create different versions of logically the same dataset. For example there can be different versions
    of the Lakes dataset. Every such version is stored as a separate dataset copy in the DD database and is uniquely identifed
    by the <strong>Dataset number</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    If you see a Lakes dataset whose dataset number is 2405, it does mean that this the 2405th version of the Lakes dataset.
    It simply means that the unique id number of that dataset copy in DD is 2405. 2406 might already be assigned to a copy
    of Groundawater dataset and 2407 might again be assigned to a new version of Lakes dataset. So the number basically indicates
    the sequence in which the dataset copies in DD are created. The bigger the number, the newer the dataset is.
