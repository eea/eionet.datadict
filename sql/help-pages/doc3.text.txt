<p>
    Revision and definitions of new datasets is handled by persons who have obtained administration rights and have logged in.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Revision</b> of data definitions: Once you log in, you will be provided with additional functions on the left-hand
        pane, enabling you to add new data definitions or revise content. This you can do manually, by writing into the forms
        on the web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can <b>import data</b> definitions directly in XML format. EEA has developed an MSAccess database for preparation
        of the data definitions, which you can then generate into XML format which in turn can then be imported into Data
        Dictionary database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each data definition can be <b>represented in XML Schema</b> format and you can see (and save) them when pressing
        the relevant link in the upper part of definition views.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding or revising the definition structure </h2>
<p>
    Each dataset, table and data element is defined by a set of attributes. A lot of them correspond to 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://isotc.iso.ch/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm">ISO 11179 standard</a> 
    for describing data elements. Data Dictionary attribute set will be relatively stable. However, the
    system is flexible and an administrator can dynamically
    <b>add/remove attributes</b> from/to the system. To search for attributes, administrator can use the <b>Attributes</b> button on the left-hand pane.
