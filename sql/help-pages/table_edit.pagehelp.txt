<h2>Table edit page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to edit the given table.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right section of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Save</strong> saves whatever you have entered into the inputs on this page. But they will not be seen
            by anybody else, until you check in the dataset working copy where this table belongs to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Save & close</strong> does the same as Save, but it also leads you back to the view page of this table.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> leads you to the view page of this table, without saving anything you entered into the
            inputs.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Below the above-mentioned buttons, the page is divided into the following sections.
</p>
<p>
    First is a section listing the table's <strong>attributes</strong> whose values you can edit. Every attribute is a name/value
    pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the <strong>+/-</strong> 
    icons next to the inputs.
    <strong>+</strong> adds a new value, <strong>-</strong> removes selected values.
    <br/> Help on every attribute is available by the help icons in their titles.
</p>
<p>
    The next section lists the links to other editable parts of this table:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Elements</strong> link leads you to the page where you can manage the elements that belong to this table.
        </li>
    </ul>
