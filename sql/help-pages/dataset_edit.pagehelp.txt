<h2>Dataset edit page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to <strong>edit the dataset working copy</strong>. Your working copy and its changes will not be
    seen by anybody else until you check it in. This you can do by going back to the view page of this working copy and using
    the buttons there.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right corner of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Save</strong> saves whatever you have entered into the inputs on this page. They will be saved to this
            working copy. They will not be seen by anybody until the working copy is checked in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Save & close</strong> does the same as Save, but it also leads you back to the view page of this working
            copy. There you will be able to check in whatever you saved.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> leads you to the view page of this working copy, without saving anything you entered
            into the inputs.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Below the above-mentioned buttons, the page is divided into the following sections.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Attributes</strong> whose values you can edit. Every attribute is a name/value pair. Some attributes can have
    several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the <strong>+/-</strong> icons next to
    the inputs.
    <strong>+</strong> adds a new value, <strong>-</strong> removes selected values.
    <br/> Help on every attribute is available by the help icons in their titles.
</p>
<p>
    Following the attributes is the section that lists the links to other editable parts of this dataset working copy:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data model</strong> leads you to the page where you can provide a visual data model to this dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dataset tables</strong> is probably the most important link as it leads you to the page where you can
            manage the tables in this dataset.
        </li>
    </ul>
