<h2>Dataset working copy view page</h2>
<p>
    This page provides view to dataset working copy.
</p>
<p>
    When you check out a dataset or create new version of it, DD creates a new copy of that dataset and that will be your 
    <strong>working copy</strong>. This is the copy where you do your changes and once you're done, you check it in. The check-in makes your
    changes visible to others. If you checked in with the Registration status of <em>Released</em> or
    <em>Recorded</em>, your changes will become visible to everybody, including un-authenticated users. If the Registration
    status was anything else, your changes will be visible to authenticated users only.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right corner of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Edit</strong> will open the dataset's edit form.</li>
        <li><strong>Check in</strong> will check in all edits that you did.</li>
        <li><strong>Undo checkout</strong> cancels the checkout and deletes the working copy.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/> The <strong>Subscribe</strong> action also available in the upper right corner will subscribe you to any changes
    made to any version of this dataset. EIONET's Unified Notification System (UNS) will send you notifications about those
    changes.
</p>
<p>
    This view page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at the
    top of the page.
</p>
<p>
    Below the quicklinks is a section with links to <strong>documents & templates</strong> available for this dataset. If
    you have the right to modify this dataset definition then you can also see the links for uploading new documents and
    managing the documents' cache. You can find more help when you get there.
</p>
<p>
    The next section lists all the <strong>attributes</strong> of this definition. Every attribute is a name/value pair.
    Some attributes can have several values at the same time. Help on every attribute is available by the help icons in their
    titles.
</p>
<p>
    If the dataset has a <strong>data model</strong> specified, the attributes are followed by a section that displayes the
    thumbnail of the data model image.
</p>
<p>
    Following the data model is the section that lists the <strong>tables</strong> in this dataset. Each table is given by
    its full name and short name, is clickable and the click leads to the table's definition view page.
</p>
<p>
    At the very bottom of the page is the list of <strong>other versions</strong> of this dataset definition. Every version
    is uniquely identified by the dataset number in the left-most column. The list also indicates the version's Registration
    status and the date is was released (relevant only when the Registration status is <em>Released</em>). The right-most
    column of this list provides the link to the view page of that version.
