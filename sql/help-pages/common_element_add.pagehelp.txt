<h2>Common element add page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to create a new common element.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right section of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> creates the new common element with the values you entered into the form below. It will
            lead you to the edit page of that new element where you can edit the rest of the element's definition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Copy</strong> enables you to create a new common element by copying the basic attributes from another,
            already existing common element. It will open a view where you can search for the element you want to copy. Once
            you've clicked the desired element in the search results, DD will create a new common element where the basic
            attributes have been taken from the element you selected to copy. It will lead you the edit page of that newly
            created element where you can edit the rest of the element's definition.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Please note that both Add and Copy buttons require you to
    <strong>specify the mandatory attributes</strong> marked with M.
    </ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <strong>
        The first thing you must do on this page is to select the new element's Type.<br/>
        If you selected the element's type to be quantitative values, the second thing you must do is to select the element's Datatype.
    </strong>
    <br/> This is emphasized because both selections reload the page with empty inputs, so you will lose anything
    you entered prior to performing any of these two selections.
</p>
<p>
    The element's type can be one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type. DD
            enables to define suggested values for these elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Once you've done the above mentioned selections, you can enter data into the rest of inputs which represent the element's
    <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is a name/value pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. You
    can define or remove such values by using the +/- icons next to the inputs. '+' adds a new value, '-' removes selected
    values.
    <br/> Help on every attribute is available by clicking their help icons.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've entered the data, you are ready to press either Add or Copy.
