<h2>Table add page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to create a new table in the given dataset.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right section of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Add</strong> creates the new table with the values you entered into the form below. It will lead you
            to the edit page of that new table where you can edit the rest of the table's definition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Copy</strong> enables you to create a new table by copying the basic attributes and non-common elements
            from another, already existing table. It will open a view where you can search for the table you want to copy.
            Once you've clicked the desired table in the search results, DD will create a new table where the basic attributes
            and non-common elements have been taken from the table you selected to copy. It will lead you to the edit page
            of that newly created table where you can edit the rest of the table's definition.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> Please note that both Add and Copy buttons require you to
    <strong>specify the mandatory attributes</strong> marked with M.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Inputs on this page represent the table's <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is a name/value pair. Some attributes
    can have several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the +/- icons next to the inputs.
    '+' adds a new value, '-' removes selected values.<br/>Help on every attribute is available by clicking their help icons.<br/>
    The <strong>Dataset</strong> attribute indicates the dataset where the new table will belong to. It is clickable and
    leads to the view page of that dataset.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've entered the data, you are ready to press either Add or Copy.
