    The role of data model is to visually describe the dataset structure (down to the level of elements if needed) in a modeling
    language. For now, models can be attached to datasets only as simple image files. The DD recognizes three image types-
    JPG, GIF and PNG. So in order to provide a dataset definition also with its data model, you should first draw the model
    with your modeling tool and then save it as a file of one of those 3 types.

    There can be two models given to a dataset. A simple model should describe the structure only on the tables level, while
    in the detailed model you can add as many details as you would like. The two models are situated on the model view's
    separate tabs.

    To add a model, click on its tab (simple or detailed) and specify the image file location either on your local file system
    or in the web. And then press Upload. As a result, the image is downloaded from given location and stored into DD file
    system.<br/> To remove the added model, click the Remove button.<br/> Note that there can be only one simple model
    and only one detailed model.<br/> Uploading a model without removing the previous one will overwrite the latter.
