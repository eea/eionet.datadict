<h2>Suggested values</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the suggested values for this element.
    <br/>
    <br/> An element's suggested values are a set of values that the Data Dictionary suggests to use if the data provider
    is not sure about which value to provide. These values are by no means mandatory to use. You serve a helping function
    only. Note that suggested values can only be specified for data elements with quantitative values, i.e. not elements
    with fixed values.
    <br/>
    <br/> Every suggested value here in this list is represented first by the value itself and then the value's definition
    and the value's short description. The latter two help to understand the meaning of the value. Values are clickable and
    they lead to the value's detailed page.
    <br/>
    <br/> If the element whose values you are looking at is in edit mode, then you can also see here in this page the 'Edit'
    button. Use this button to go into mode where you can add/remove new/existing values.
