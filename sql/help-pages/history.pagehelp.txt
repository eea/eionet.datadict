<h2>History of a dataset or common element</h2>
<p>
    The Data Dictionary keeps history of datasets and common elements.<br/> The version numbers are called <b>CheckInNo</b>    and they are incremented<br/> every time a definition of a dataset or common element is checked in and the user has selected
    the option for updating the dataset's or element's version (see more in helps of dataset, table and element edit pages).
    <br/>
    <br/> This page lists the history of the selected dataset or common element.<br/>
    <b>Please note that for un-authenticated users the history contains only the
    definitions in Released status.</b><br/> Every row in this list represents a previous version of the selected<br/> dataset
    or element. Every version is identified by CheckInNo which is clickable and leads to the version's detailed view. Note
    that you cannot edit history!
    <br/><br/> The <b>User</b> column stands for the user who created the version.<br/> The <b>Date</b> represents the date
    of the creation of the version.
    <br/>
    <br/> If this is a dataset history and you see a
    <font color="red">'D'</font> sign behind the version, it means it has been deleted by you. You can go to 'Restore datasets' page by clicking
    this sign.
