<h2>Restore datasets</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the datasets versions that have been non-completely deleted. The latter means that they can be restored.
    And it is here on this page where you can restore them.
</p>
<p>
    The upper left corner has 2 buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Restore selected</strong> restores the selected dataset versions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Delete selected</strong> deletes the selected dataset versions permanently. They latter means they cannot
            be restored.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The list has 4 columns:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong>left-most</strong> column contains the checkboxes enabling selection of dataset versions that you
            want to restore or delete for good.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dataset</strong> indicates the name of the dataset version.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Version</strong> indicates the version identifier of the particular dataset version listed. Note that
            version identifier 2405 does not mean that this is the 2405th version of the dataset. It is simply the unique
            identifier of the particular dataset version and it simply happens to be numeric.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tables</strong> listing the dataset's tables by their full names.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    If you place the mouse over column header and the latter activates, it means the list is <strong>sortable</strong> by
    that column. Click the column header to perform the sorting.
