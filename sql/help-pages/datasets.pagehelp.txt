<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>
This page lists the <strong>latest versions</strong> of datasets in any status or
datasets matching your search criteria if you reached this page
by submitting the dataset search form. The latter is accessible by clicking the
<strong>Search</strong> link in the upper right corner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The datasets NOT in Recorded or Released status are inaccessible
for un-authenticated users!</strong>
</p>
<p>
All users can see at least 3 columns here:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dataset</strong> indicating the dataset's full name.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Status</strong> indicating the dataset's Registration status.
The latter is indictaed by icons, the labels of which are dispalyed
when placing the mouse over them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tables</strong> listing the dataset's tables by their full names.
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
If you reached this page by submitting the dataset search form and you
chose to search for historic versions too, then you can also see a 4th
column:<br/>
<strong>Version</strong> indicating the version identifier of
the particular dataset version listed. <strong>Note that version identifier
2405 does not mean that this is the 2405th version of the dataset. It is
simply the unique identifier of the particular dataset version and it simply
happens to be numeric.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you place the mouse over column header and the latter activates, it means the list
is <strong>sortable</strong> by that column. Click the column header to perform the sorting.

Each dataset and common element definition in Data Dictionary goes through a
life-cycle. Its phases are marked by <strong>Registration status</strong>
(<em>aka</em> simply status). The Registration status of a dataset definition
is specified by the data definers and can be any one of the following: 
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Released</strong> (5 ticks) means the definition is accepted by ETCs
and EEA and is released for countries to use for download of technical guidelines
and templates. Definitions in this status can be accessed by countries.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Qualified</strong> (4 ticks) level is for closing discussions between ETCs
and EEA. Definitions in this status <em>cannot be accessed by countries.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Recorded</strong> (3 ticks) level is for discussions between ETCs and countries
if applicable. Otherwise the definition will skip this status and move directly to the
Qualified status. Definitions in Recorded status can be accessed by countries.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Candidate</strong> (2 ticks) means definitions that are included in the Data
Dictionary by the EEA or ETC data  managers. This level is for opening discussions between
ETCs and EEA. Definitions in this status <em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Incomplete</strong> (1 tick) means either existing definitions under consideration
to include them into Data Dictionary or new definitions under development where the Data Dictionary
is used  as a structuring tool or to test dataflows. Definitions in this status
<em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For authenticated users the left-most column will contain one of the two:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Checkboxes</strong> for selecting datasets for deletion (if the user has permission
to delete the particular dataset).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Red asterisks</strong> (<span style="color:red">*</span>) indicating that the dataset
has been checked out by somebody. The EIONET user name of that somebody will be displayed if
placing the mouse over the asterisk.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Authenticated users can also see the following buttons on top of the list:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add new</strong> leads you to the page where you can add a new dataset.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Delete selected</strong> deletes the selected datasets and refreshes this page.
<strong>Note that if you reached this page by submitting the dataset search form and you chose
to search for historic versions too, then only the selected dataset version is deleted!
Otherwise only the latest version of the dataset is deleted.
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Only authenticated users can see the <strong>Restore</strong> action link in the
upper right corner. It leads to the list of dataset versions in the recycle bin.
The latter contains the dataset versions that were not completely deleted (when
deleting a dataset, DD asks if you want to delete it completely or keep for
possibility of restoration). The recycle bin page allows you to restore selected
dataset versions and you can find more help there.
