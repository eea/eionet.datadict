<h2>Allowable value</h2>
<p>
    This page lists the details of the selected allowable value (aka fixed value). If you're in view mode, those details will
    not be editable. If you're in edit mode, you find them editable and you can submit your edits by clicking 'Save'. The
    'Delete' button will delete this allowable value.
    <br/> Both Definition and Short description should describe the value's meaning, but Definition should be a bit broader
    than Short description.
