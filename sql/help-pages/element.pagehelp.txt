<h2>Non-common element view page</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Non-common elements</strong> belong into a certain single table and they cannot be used in any other tables.
    They are defined within that certain table and they do not have a life outside of that table.
    <br/>
    <strong>Common elements</strong> do not belong into a certain single table. They can be used in many tables. A perfect
    example of a common element is for example CountryCode. It is obvious that CountryCode is probably needed in many datasets.
</p>
<p>
    The view page of non-common elements is slightly different from the view page of common ones.
</p>
<p>
    If you have authenticated yourself and this element is in a dataset working copy and it is your working copy then you can
    see the following buttons in the upper right corner:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Edit</strong> leads to the edit page this element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Delete</strong> deletes this element from this table in this dataset working copy and redirects you to
            the view page this table.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This page is divided into sections which you can quickly access by using the <strong>quicklinks</strong> at the top of
    the page.
</p>
<p>
    Below the quicklinks is a section with links to <strong>XML schema</strong> and possibly other formats of this element
    definition.
</p>
<p>
    Next is a section that states the element's type. It can be one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type. DD
            enables to define suggested values for these elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Following the element's type is a section that lists the element's <strong>attributes</strong>. Every attribute is a
    name/value pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. Help on every attribute is available by the
    help icons in their titles.
    <br/> The <strong>Table</strong> and <strong>Dataset</strong> attributes indicate the table and dataset the element belongs
    to. If this is a dataset working copy and it is your working copy, the dataset name is followed by this marker:
    <span
        style="color:red">(Working copy)</span>. If it is somebody else's working copy, the dataset name is followed by this marker: <span style="color:red">(checked out by <em>username</em>)</span>.
        <br/> Both the dataset and table name are clickable and the click leads to their view pages.
</p>
<p>
    Following the attributes is a section that lists one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Allowable values</strong> are a synonym of fixed values and they are listed if the element's type is
            fixed values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suggested values</strong> are listed if the element's type is quantitative values. They are values suggested
            to the data supplier if he does not know or is not sure what to enter. The data supplier is not obliged to use
            them.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If this element has <strong>foreign key relations</strong> to some other elements in this dataset, the allowable/fixed
    values section is followed by a section that lists those relations. The 1st column contains the name of the related element
    (it is clickable and the click leads to the view page of that element). The 2nd column contains the name of the table
    where the related element resides.
