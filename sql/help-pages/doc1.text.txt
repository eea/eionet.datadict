<h1>Data Dictionary - functions, services and users</h1>

<p>The Data Dictionary is used to support the delivery of environmental data by countries to Reportnet. The contents in the
    data dictionary are used to generate pdfs of the technical specifications for dataflows as well as Excel templates. The
    Data Dictionary also introduces the possibility of simple automated validation of deliveries by countries and facilitates
    the development of data submission interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    Data Dictionary holds definitions of datasets, tables and data elements. Each of these three levels is defined by a set of
    attributes, the core set of which corresponds to <a href="http://isotc.iso.ch/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2489/Ittf_Home/PubliclyAvailableStandards.htm">ISO 11179
    standard</a> for describing data elements. The whole attribute set is flexible and attributes can be added / removed from/to
    the system.
</p>

<p>The Data Dictionary provides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        countries with detailed specifications of what to produce and report, on a website as well as in pdf documents for download;</li>
    <li>
        data reporters with Excel templates to facilitate reporting;</li>
    <li>
        definitions of parameters as input for technical quality control and automated validation of the reported data;</li>
    <li>
        those using data reported by countries with a single point of reference for obtaining information about the specifications;</li>
    <li>
        a platform for harmonisation discussions and processes;</li>
    <li>
        a simple means to reuse existing specifications when reporting obligations are revised or new ones are defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reporting obligations are usually long-lasting. The definitions found in the Data Dictionary, therefore, are relatively stable,
    but are updated prior to a new dataflow collection.</p>

<p>The users of the Data Dictionary are data reporters and data definers as well as dataflow administrators.</p>
