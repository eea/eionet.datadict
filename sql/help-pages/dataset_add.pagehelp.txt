<h2>Add a dataset</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to define a new dataset, i.e. add a new dataset definition.
</p>
<p>
    The page lists the definition's <strong>attributes</strong> whose values you can specify. Every attribute is a name/value
    pair. Some attributes can have several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the +/-
    icons next to the inputs. '+' adds a new value, '-' removes selected values.
    <br/> Help on every attribute is available by clicking their help icons.
</p>
<p>
    The rest of this dataset definition you can edit once you've submitted these attributes by clicking <strong>Add</strong> 
    on top of the page. DD will create the dataset definition and lead you to its edit page.
