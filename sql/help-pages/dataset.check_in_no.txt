<h2>CheckInNo</h2>
<p>
    The Data Dictionary keeps history of datasets and common elements.<br/> The version numbers are called <b>CheckInNo</b> 
    and they are incremented every time a definition of a dataset or common element is checked in and the user has selected
    the option for updating the dataset's or element's version (see more in helps of dataset, table and element edit pages).
