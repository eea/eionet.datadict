<h2>Common element edit page</h2>
<p>
    This page enables you to <strong>edit the common element working copy</strong>. Your working copy and its changes will
    not be seen by anybody else until you check it in. This you can do by going back to the view page of this working copy
    and using the buttons there.
</p>
<p>
    The upper right section of the page contains the following buttons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Save</strong> saves whatever you have entered into the inputs on this page. They will be saved to this
            working copy. They will not be seen by anybody until the working copy is checked in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Save & close</strong> does the same as Save, but it also leads you back to the view page of this working
            copy. There you will be able to check in whatever you saved.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cancel</strong> leads you to the view page of this working copy, without saving anything you entered
            into the inputs.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Below the above-mentioned buttons, the page is divided into the following sections.
</p>
<p>
    Element type, which can be one of two:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH FIXED VALUES</strong> is an element where predefined values are the only accepted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DATA ELEMENT WITH QUANTITATIVE VALUES</strong> can have any values within the element's data type. DD
            enables to define suggested values for these elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The next section lists the <strong>attributes</strong> whose values you can edit. Every attribute is a name/value pair.
    Some attributes can have several values at the same time. You can define or remove such values by using the <strong>+/-</strong> icons next to the inputs.
    <strong>+</strong> adds a new value, <strong>-</strong> removes selected values.
    <br/> Help on every attribute is available by the help icons in their titles.
</p>
<p>
    Following the attributes is the section that lists the links to other editable parts of this common element working copy:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Allowable values</strong> is a synonym for fixed values and this link is displayed only if the element's
            type is FIXED VALUES. It leads you to the page where you can manage this element's allowable/fixed values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suggested values</strong> link is displayed only if the element's type is QUANTITATIVE VALUES. They are
            values suggested to the data supplier if he does not know or is not sure what to enter. The link leads you to
            the page where you can manage this element's suggested values.
        </li>
    </ul>
