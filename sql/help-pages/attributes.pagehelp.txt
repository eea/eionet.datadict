    An attribute in Data Dictionary's context is an attribute of a definition of a dataset, table or data element. Most common
    attribute of all is 'Name', standing for the name of the defined object. Other attributes could be for example 'Definition',
    'Keyword', etc. Every attribute is uniquely identified by its <b>Short name</b>.

<p>
    Every attribute in its instance is a name/value pair. For example 'Name', 'Definition' and 'Keyword' are a good example of
    attributes.<br/> Note that attributes can have pre-fixed sets of allowable values. Often these values are some kind
    of codes. For example an attribute called 'Datatype' can have values like 'Text', 'Integer' and 'Boolean'.<br/> Also,
    an attribute in its instance can have multiple values at the same time. For example 'Keyword' could be 'environment',
    'water' and 'lake' all at the same time.
