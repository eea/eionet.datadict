    All users can see at least 3 columns here:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Element</strong> indicating the element's short name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Type</strong> indicating the element's type. It can be one of two: <em>Fixed values</em> or <em>Quantitative</em>.
            The first means an element where predefined values are the only allowed values. The second means an element that
            can have any values within the element's data type.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Status</strong> indicating the element's Registration status. The different statuses are marked by certain
            icons. The status names are dispalyed when placing the mouse over those icons.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/> If you chose to search for historic versions too, then you can also see a 4th column:<br/>
    <strong>Version</strong> indicating the version identifier of the particular element version.
    <strong>Note that version identifier 2405 does not mean that this is the 2405th version of the element.
It is simply the unique identifier of the particular element version and it simply happens to be numeric.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you place the mouse over column header and the latter activates, it means the list is <strong>sortable</strong> by
    that column. Click the column header to perform the sorting.

    As mentioned above, statuses are marked by certain icons and you can see the status name by placing the mouse over the icon.
    Here's what different status names mean:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Released</strong> (5 ticks) means the definition is accepted by ETCs and EEA and is released for countries
            to use for download of technical guidelines and templates. Definitions in this status can be accessed by countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Qualified</strong> (4 ticks) level is for closing discussions between ETCs and EEA. Definitions in this
            status <em>cannot be accessed by countries.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recorded</strong> (3 ticks) level is for discussions between ETCs and countries if applicable. Otherwise
            the definition will skip this status and move directly to the Qualified status. Definitions in Recorded status
            can be accessed by countries.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Candidate</strong> (2 ticks) means definitions that are included in the Data Dictionary by the EEA or
            ETC data managers. This level is for opening discussions between ETCs and EEA. Definitions in this status <em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Incomplete</strong> (1 tick) means either existing definitions under consideration to include them into
            Data Dictionary or new definitions under development where the Data Dictionary is used as a structuring tool
            or to test dataflows. Definitions in this status
            <em>cannot be accessed by countries</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
