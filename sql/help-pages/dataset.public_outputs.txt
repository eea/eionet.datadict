<h2>Public outputs</h2>
<p>
    Public outputs are these automatically generated outputs (in the documents & templates section at the top of definition pages)
    that should be availabale on this dataset definition for un-authenticated (i.e. non-logged-in) users.
    <br/> This attribute enables to control which exactly should they be. At the moment only two outputs are supported in
    this function- the PDF output and the MS Excel output. Whatever you set here on the dataset level, is also applied on
    its lower levels. This means that if you don't allow to show the MS Excel template for this dataset, it is also not allowed
    for its tables.
