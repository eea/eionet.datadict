<h2>Data import</h2>
<p>
    This page enables to import the data created by DD <b>Import tool</b>.
    <br/>
    <br/> DD has an MS Access-based helper tool called <b>Import tool</b>.<br/> This tool enables to define datasets, tables
    and elements (but no attributes!) in a flat table and then afterwards populate the definitions into DD database, using
    <b>XML</b> as an intermediate format.<br/> The reason for such a tool is simply because when entering a large amount
    of definitions,<br/> a flat table might be handier than the web-based user interface with its many different views<br/> 
    and clicking back and forth in between them.<br/> More on how to use Import tool is available
    <br/>
    <br/> The output of Import tool is an XML file. This page enables to import that XML file. Locating the file by using
    the 'Browse' button or provide the file's URL if it's available on the web. Then press <b>'Import' button</b>.<br/> The
    'Clear' button will clear the inputs.<br/> Import will result in the list of import results which are rather informative.
    <br/>
    <br/> If you came to this page by clicking 'Import...' on the list of some element's
    <b>allowable values</b>, there will be a red text notifying that you are about to import allowable values for the selected
    element. Import tool enables to generate an XML file with allowable values only and this here is the page where you can
    import them.
