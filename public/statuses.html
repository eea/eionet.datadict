<h2>Registration status</h2>
    
<p> Each dataset in data dictionary goes through a life-cycle. Its phases are 
  marked by a registration status. The status of a dataset is shown graphically 
  by how many ticks are shown in this column. The registration status of a dataset 
  is specified by the data definers and can be in one of the following statuses: 
</p>
<h3>Released (5 ticks)</h3>
<p> The dataset is accepted by ETCs and EEA and is released for countries to use 
  for download of technical guidelines and templates. Datasets in this status 
  can be accessed by countries. </p>
<h3>Qualified (4 ticks)</h3>
<p> All mandatory metadata are entered in this status. This level is for closing 
  discussions between ETCs and EEA. Datasets in this status cannot be accessed 
  by countries. </p>
<h3>Recorded (3 ticks)</h3>
<p> All mandatory metadata are entered in this status. This level is for discussions 
  between ETCs and countries if applicable. Otherwise the dataset will skip this 
  status and move directly to a Qualified status. Datasets in Recorded status 
  can be accessed by countries. </p>
<h3>Candidate (2 ticks)</h3>
<p> Dataflows that are included in the data dictionary by the EEA or ETC data 
  managers. This level is for opening discussions between ETCs and EEA. Datasets 
  in this status cannot be accessed by countries. </p>
<h3>Incomplete (1 tick)</h3>
<p> This can be existing dataflows under consideration to be included in the data 
  dictionary or new dataflows under development where the data dictionary is used 
  as a structuring tool or to test dataflows. At a minimum metadata attributes 
  of submitter organisation and submitter phone number are required for this status.<br/>
  Datasets in this status cannot be accessed by countries.</p>
