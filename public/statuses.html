<h2>Registration statuses</h2>
    <p>
        Each data definition in Data Dictionary (DD) goes through a life-cycle. Its phases are marked
        by Registration Statuses. They are specified by the data definers and a definition can be
        in one of the following statuses:
    </p>
    <h3>Incomplete</h3>
    <p>
        Existing dataflows under consideration to be included in DD; new dataflows under development
        where DD is used as a structuring tool; test dataflows. <span class="caution">(At least metadata
        attributes of Submitter organisation and Submitter phone number are required for this status!).<br/>
        This status is not published for countries!
        </span>
    </p>
    <h3>Candidate</h3>	
    <p>
        Dataflows to be included in DD (of relevance to countries). This level is for opening discussions
        between ETCs and EEA. <span class="caution">(At least metadata attributes of Submitter organisation
        and Submitter phone number are required for this status!).<br/>
        This status is not published for countries!

        and countries. <span class="caution">So it is published for countries as well!</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Qualified</h3>

    </p>
