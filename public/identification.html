    <h2>Definition identifiers</h2>
	<h3 id="short_name">Identifier</h3>
	<p>
            Identifier is a caharcter string used in DD to distinguish different elements, tables and datasets within the
			same context. It's maximum length is 50 caharcters and it must have no white space! Identifiers will be used
            as tag names to distinguish elements in XML or whatever formatted data reporting!
            <div class="caution">A dataset Identifier must be unique! A table Identifier must be unique within its owner
			dataset! A data element Identifier must be unique within its owner table!<br/>
            So logically a dataset is uniquely identified by its Identifier. A table is is uniquely identified by its
            Identifier and owner dataset. A data element is uniquely identified by its Identifier and owner table.

            Relevant for definitions of tables and data elements only. Indicates the parent dataset into which
            the defined table or element should belong.

	<h3 id="table">Table</h3>
	<p>
            Relevant for definitions of data elements only. Indicates the parent table into which the defined
            data element should belong.

	<h3 id="version">Version</h3>

            Data Dictionary keeps history of data definitions. Definition of a dataset with a given Identifier can have
            several versions. Definition of a table with a given Identifier in a given dataset can have several versions.
            Definition of a data element with a given Identifier in a given table can have several versions.
            The version numbers are automatically generated by Data Dictionary. You can not enter them, but you can control
			when they're updated. See more at <a href="javascript:alert('Under construction!')">versioning.</a>
