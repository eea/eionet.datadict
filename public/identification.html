    <h2>Definition identifiers</h2>
	<h3 id="short_name">Short name</h3>
	<p>
            Short name is a shorter version (max 50 letters) of a data element's name that must have no white space.
            It is this name that will be used to identify data elements in XML or whatever formatted data reporting!
            <div class="caution">A dataset short name must be unique! A table short name must be unique within dataset!
            A data element short name must be unique within table!<br/>
            So logically a dataset is uniquely identified by its short name. A table is is uniquely identified by its
            short name and owner dataset. A data element is uniquely identified by its short name and owner table.

	<h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            Relevant for definitions of tables and data elements only. Indicates the parent dataset into which
            the defined table or element should belong.
	</p>
	<h3 id="table">Table</h3>
	<p>
            Relevant for definitions of data elements only. Indicates the parent table into which the defined
            data element should belong.
	</p>
	<h3 id="version">Version</h3>
	<p>
            Data Dictionary keeps history of data definitions. Definition of a dataset with given short name can have
            several versions. Definition of a table with given short name in given dataset can have several versions.
            Definition of a data element with given short name in given table can have several versions.
            The version numbers are automatically generated by Data Dictionary. You can not enter them. There are
            certain rules when a version is incremented. In some cases you can have control over that. See more at
