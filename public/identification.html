<h2>Static attribute help</h2>
<p>This help is a general help that applies to all static attributes at different 
  levels within the data dictionary. <br>
</p>
<h3 id="identifier">Identifier</h3>
	
<p> Identifier is a unique identifier that is mainly used for internal purposes 
  in the data dictionary. It is a character string used to distinguish different 
  elements, tables and datasets within the same context. It's maximum length is 
  50 characters and it must have no blank spaces. Identifiers are used as names 
  to distinguish elements in XML or formatted data reporting. A table identifier 
  must be unique within its parent dataset. A data element identifier must be 
  unique within its parent table.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
        
<p> A dataset is is a collection of tables containing definitions and specifications 
  for reported data. Within datasets are tables. Tables are composed of data elements 
  (columns) and values (rows).</p>
	
<h3 id="table">Table</h3>
	
<p>A table in Reportnet's and Data Dictionary's context is a table in a dataset. 
  It can be either a data table or a lookup table for how to interpret the data. 
  A lookup table can be for example made for holding country codes or whichever 
  other code lists.Tables are composed of data elements (columns) and values (rows).<br>
</p>
<h3 id="version">Last Check in number</h3>
	
<p> Data Dictionary keeps history of data definitions. </p>
<p>The Data Dictionary keeps history of datasets, tables and elements. The version 
  numbers are called <i>LastCheckInNo</i> and they are incremented<br>
  every time the dataset, table or element is checked in <b>AND</b> if the user 
  has selected the update <i>LastCheckInNo</i> option (see more in help on dataset, 
  table and element edit pages).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <i>LastCheckInNo</i> numbers are automatically generated by Data Dictionary. 
  You can not enter them, but data definers can control when they're updated.</p>
	<h3 id="short_name">Short name</h3>
	
<p>A short name is a character string used to operationally identify content components 
  within the data dictionary. ie how users and data definers commonly refer to 
  a table or an element or a dataset. A short name is not used as a unique identifier 
  in Data Dictionary. For example, several tables in a dataset can have the same<br>
  name. A short name can contain any characters, including white space.</p>
