HOW TO RUN UNIT TESTS

FROM ANT:

To run the database tests you must first create a database called 'test_dd' on
your local system. You must then grant permissions:

GRANT ALL ON test_dd.* to ddtest@localhost identified by 'testpwd';

Then you import the table structure as:

mysql -u ddtest -p test_dd <../dd-struct.sql

Finally the eionet/test/input*.xml must be placed in the classes directory
if ant doesn't do it already.
