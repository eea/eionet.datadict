In a way DD datasets are stand-alone\ndatabases. Usually they come as MS Access databases or MS Excel files. They are subject to certain\ndata flows and obliged to be reported by Reportnet players according to legislation. In many cases\na dataset corresponds to a dataflow. For example there is the CDDA dataset defined in DD, which\ncontains the information about reported data within that same-named data flow\n</p>\n\n<p>\n	<b>Tables</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nA table in DD\'s context is a table in dataset. Columns in a table stand for data elements, rows stand\nfor their values.\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/delem_description.gif\"></p>\n\n<p>\n	<b>Data elements</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nA data element in Data Dictionary\'s context is a column in a table. The figure above provides a visual\nrepresentation of what a table and its elements (columns) are.<br/>\nOn the highest level there are two classes of data elements in DD:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>non-common elements</b> belong into a certain single table and they cannot be used in any other tables.\nThey are defined within that certain table and they do not have a life outside of that table.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>common elements</b> do not belong into a certain single tables. They can be used in many tables, i.e.\nthey can be part of many tables. You could also call them harmonised elements. They are potential candidates\nto be used in many datasets and tables and thus have been harmonised to avoid repetitions. A perfect example\nof a common element is for example CountryCode. It is obvious that CountryCode is probably needed in all\ndatasets and many tables.\n</li>\n</ul>\nData elements could be for example StationCode, StationType, Longitude, etc. And while Longitude can be measured\nand StationCode could be anything, StationType would probably have values from a pre-fixed set. These differences\nrepresent the 2 distinct data element types that DD recognizes:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Element with fixed values (aka allowable values or code lists)</b><br/>\nAn element where predefined values are the only accepted values. In ISO 11179 terms referred as \"characteristic 1\"\nor \"characteristic of type 1\".\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Element with quantitative values (aka measured values)</b><br/>\nAn element that can have any values within the element\'s data type. In ISO 11179 terms referred as \"characteristic 2\"\nor \"characteristic of type 2\". DD enables to define <b>suggested values</b> for these elements.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n	<b>Attributes</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nDatasets, tables and elements in DD are defined by a set of attributes, the core set of which corresponds to ISO 11179\nstandard for describing data elements. The rest of the attributes are usually specific to Reportnet business rules and\nin any case the attribute set is flexible- an administrator can dynamically add/remove attributes to/from the system.\nMost common attribute of all is \'Name\', standing for the name of the defined object. Other attributes could be for\nexample \'Definition\', \'Version\', etc. There are two types of attributes recognized by DD:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Simple attribute</b><br/>\nEvery such attribute in its instance is a name/value pair. They represent the same concept of attribute as in ISO 11179\npart 3. For example the mentioned \'Name\', \'Definition\' and \'Version\' are a good examples of simple attributes.\n<b>NB!</b> Note that simple attributes can have pre-fixed sets of allowable values, just like the elements. Often these\nvalues are some kind of codes.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Complex attribute</b><br/>\nA complex attribute in DD\'s context is almost the same as a simple attribute. The difference is that while a simple attribute\nis a name/value pair, a complex attribute is a set of name/value pairs. Every such pair is called a field. For example address\nwould consist of country, city and street fields. A set of these fields combines a complex attribute value row. The set of these\nrows is what is called the complex attribute\'s value.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nImportant simple attributes when defining a data element are: \n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Datatype</b><br/>\nIndicates if the element\'s values are strings, integers, booleans, etc. Also specifies if decimals are to be used, and how many\ndecimals are accepted.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>MaxSize/MinSize</b><br/>\nThe max/min length of a data element value in terms of digits or characters. For example if an element\'s MaxSize is 4, its value\n\'hello\' is one char too long. Or if an element\'s MinSize is 5, its value \'146\' is one digit too short.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>MaxValue/MinValue</b><br/>\nCan be applied only to data elements of numeric Datatype and limits the element\'s numeric value. i.e. value \'9.55\' is too much if\nMaxValue is \'9\'.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nImportant complex attributes when defining a dataset, table or element are: \n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>SubmitOrganisation</b><br/>\nThe organisation that has added or changed  the data element definition. This is mandatory to specify for all dataset, table and\nelement definitions!\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>RegistrationAuthority</b><br/>\nInstitution authorised to register the data definitions.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>\nMore about each and every attribute you can learn through using theDD, because each and every attribute in the DD user pages is\nprovided with online help about its meaning and point.\n</b>\n</p>','','400','400');
