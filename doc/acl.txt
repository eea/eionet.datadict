The access control is maintained in both text files and two tables in
the MySQL database.

If you want to batch modify all acls, then you can do something like
this in sql:

insert into ACL_ROWS (ACL_ID, TYPE, ENTRY_TYPE, PRINCIPAL, PERMISSIONS, STATUS)
select distinct ACL_ID, 'object', 'user', 'palitmet', 'u,d,w,c', 1 from ACLS;
